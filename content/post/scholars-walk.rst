Scholars Walk Time Traveller
============================

The University of Minnesota has a `Scholar's Walk`_ which celebrates great
persons affiliated with the U and the awards they've won.  One display labeled
"Historical Giants" remains without any names.  Since the U can't reasonably be
anticipating any new history, I imagine that four years after installation
there's still a committee somewhere arguing about which department gets more
names.  Not content to wait for committee I decided to add a historical giant of
my own -- a time traveller.

The displays are stone boxes with two panes of glass.  The outermost pane of
glass extends a quarter inch on steel pegs and shows the University branding and
the category information.  The innermost pane is recessed three inches and
contains the names of the honorees.  I figured that the outermost glass would
provide the necessary gloss, and that any way I could get names behind it and at
the right depth would look okay.

I had vinyl lettering made with the wording I wanted and applied it to some
laboriously-cut thin lexan.  In tests I could I could bend the lexan ninety
degrees with just a four inch radius.  That flexibility was enough that I could
slide the insert in the bottom of the display (the top was sealed against
weather).

I showed up early one morning, slipped the insert into place between the two
pieces of glass, and was very pleased with the result.  The white lettering
looked sufficiently etched once behind the shiny outer glass, the fonts and
sizes matched nearby displays, and the borders of the lexan insert were nearly
invisible.  The text is easier to read in the big photo links below, but it
lists a physicist with a dis-joint lifespan lauded "for her uniquely important
contributions to the understanding of time travel".

Sadly, the insert was removed a few months later, and before someone who can
actually take a decent picture got to it.  Removing it probably meant
disassembling the box to some extent as the very springy plastic insert wouldn't
adopt the bend required to make it around the corner without significant
coercion not applicable from out side the box.
