Oldenburg Survey Results Released
---------------------------------

I went ahead and aggregated the survey results related to this previous entry about starting a social club:

The results can be found at:

Sadly, I've been forced to conclude that there's just no way to start something like I'd hoped for without a good year's worth of operating expenses in the bank.  You need members to gather dues, need dues to open the club, and need the club to gather members.

I still believe the basic idea is tenable, and that operating finances wouldn't be out of line with expected revenues, but barring a grant of some sort I just don't see a way to do it.
