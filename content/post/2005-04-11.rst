CVS Commit Blocking
-------------------

When editing source files checked out from CVS I sometimes want to prevent them from going back in to source control without further edits. Until now I've just used  // FIXME  comments and have tried to remember to grep for FIXMEs before committing the files back.

Problem is others use FIXME comments, and sometimes I forget to grep. So I've tweaked our CVSROOT files to prevent custom FIXME tags from going in to source control.

I appended this line to CVSROOT/commitinfo::

	ALL $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/checkforry4an

Added this line to CVSROOT/checkoutlist::

	checkforry4an Tell Ry4an he broke something with checkforry4an

and crated a file named CVSROOT/checkforry4an containing::

	#!/bin/sh

	BASE=$1
	shift

	for thefile in "$@" ; do
	    if echo $thefile | grep -v Foreign | grep -q '.java$' ; then
		if grep -s -q 'FIXME RY4AN' $thefile ; then
		    echo found a FIXME RY4AN in $thefile
		    exit 1
		fi
	    fi
	done

Now when I put a  // FIXME RY4AN  comment into a source file commits break until I remove it.
