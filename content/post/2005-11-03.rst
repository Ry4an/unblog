Halloween 2005
--------------

Last weekend Bridget, Joe, and I threw our annual Halloween party.  It was well attended and everyone seemed to have a good time.  It peaked around midnight with a good 50 people inside and out, which is about the same as last year.

This year we did a little more with the decor including the building of a coffin cut-out and a few corpses.  The walls got covered with cheesy off the shelf decorations that drew more praise than anything else -- go figure.

Photos are starting to get posted by various attendees, and I'll post them here as more appear.  Not all photos in all sets are from our party, but a goodly fraction are:
