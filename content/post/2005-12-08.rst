Email Sub-Address Spam Frequency
--------------------------------

My email server is configured such that email to ry4an-anything@ry4an.org gets correctly delivered to me.  The dash and whatever is after it are retained but ignored completely.

When I give an email address to a company, say Northwest Airlines,I'll give them an email address that shows to whom it was given, say ry4an``-nwa``@ry4an.org.  By doing this I'm able to check which companies are giving/selling/leaking my email address to spammers. Some of the leaks are surprising -- just a few weeks after giving out ry4an-philmont for the first time, giving it to the Boy Scouts, I started getting porn spam on it.  When I called to let them know about the leak they assured me it was impossible.

Last month I decided to save all of my inbound spam and run some totals to see which sub-addresses got the most spam.  Here are the counts:

*  6427 total spam messages to ry4an.org in 34 days

*  679 spam messages to plain ry4an*@*ry4an.org

*  the 10 most spammed sub-addresses were

[Table not converted]

So it looks like the worst offenders aren't comanies to whom I've given my email address, but rather letting them get posted to the internet for automated crawlers to harvest.

Yeah, the one I gave to United actually garners me the most spam.  I emailed them to complain but was brushed off relatively quickly.
