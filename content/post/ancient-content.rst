I just rebuilt the ry4an.org server, and as part of the migration I realized
a still had a lot of very old, almost embarrassing content online.  I took the
broken or not-conceivably interesting stuff off-line and am serving up `410
GONE`_ responses for it.

There exists, however, a broad swath of stuff that's not yet entirely useless,
but is more than ten years old and not stuff I would likely post today.  For all
of these pages I've left the content up, but you first have to click through
a modal dialog warning you you're looking at very old stuff I don't necessarily
endorse.  That pop up looks like this:

An example can be found here: https://ry4an.org/rrr/ .  (Though, if anyone still
wants to race from point to point in the twin cities during the worst of rush
hour I *still* think it's an awesome idea.)

Being the sort of person that I am I automated the process of adding those
warnings to anything that hasn't been modified in at least 10 years.  So, if
you got an ancient content warning when viewing this page: Hello 2021!

If you follow a link or bookmark to ry4an.org and you get a 404 Not Found, let
me know.  Everything should either still be there or should give a 410 GONE so
you know it's not there on purpose.
