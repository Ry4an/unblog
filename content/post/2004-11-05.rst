Dorm Apology Ad
---------------

On Tuesday some friends and I were talking about how we immaturely approached alcohol back in the dorms, and I was thinking it would be fun to take out a full (or half) page ad in the student paper, The Minnesota Daily, like this:

  WE LIVED IN THE DORMS.  WE DRANK.

    WE COULDN'T HOLD OUR LIQUOR.

  Thank you, Resident Hall Facilities Staff, for your

  service above and beyond the call of duty.  We're sorry.

I've contacted The Daily about getting a rate sheet, meanwhile there are a few questions to be answered:

  - Is this insulting?  Funny or no, I don't want to actually insult the

    fine residence hall maintenance staff.

  - How much would folks pay to be one of the people in the ad?

    Depending on the cost of this thing I might need sponsorship from the other people in the ad.

  - Would you be interested in being in the ad?  You could use a fake

    name if that changes anything.  Hell, you could sponsor someone else.

So if I could get a little feedback, it'd be great.  Is this funny or just a dumb idea I should let die?
