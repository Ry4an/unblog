Graduation Form Letter
======================

We just passed through another graduation season, and for the second year
running I was able to get by with the same stack of form letters::

    Dear _______________________________,

    My ( Congratulations | Condolences | ___________________ ) on your recent (
    Graduation | Eagle Rank | Loss | ___________________ ).  It is with ( Great Joy
    | a Heavy Heart ) that I received the news.  I’m sure it took a lot of ( Hard
    Work | Cigarettes ) to make it happen.

    I’m sure you’ll have a ( great time | good cry ) at the ( open house | wake )
    and ( regret | am glad) that I ( can | cannot ) attend.

    As you move on to your next phase in life please remember:

    [  ] the importance of hard work
    [  ] the risks of smoking
    [  ] there are other fish in the sea
    [  ] don’t have your mom send out your graduation invites -- you’re an adult now
    [  ] ________________________________________

    and the value of personal correspondence.

    Sincerely, your (Cousin | Scoutmaster | Parolee | _____________________),

    Ry4an Brase

    Enclosures (1): ( Check | Card | Gift | Best Wishes )

It's available as a `Google Doc`_.
