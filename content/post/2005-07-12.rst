Shades of Coke Blind Taste Test
-------------------------------

On Sunday Kate Bauer and I ran and participated in a double blind random taste test of the various shades of Coca-Cola.  Into numbered glasses Kate poured the samples from bottles whose labels I'd replaced with lettered labels.  The samples we included were:

*  Coke

*  Diet Coke

*  Diet Coke with Splenda

*  Coke C2 (already hard to find!)

*  Coke Zero

Kate was 3 for 5 with only Coke and C2 transposed.  I got only one of them right (everyone knows the gasoline flavor of Diet Coke).  From this we can conclude that either Kate's got a much better palate than I do or that she drinks a lot of Coke when I'm not looking.
