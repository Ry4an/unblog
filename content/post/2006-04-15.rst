Meager Home Improvements
------------------------

After moving into the house I started a series of small home improvement tasks.  Some of them have genuine safety reasons but many happened only because changing things demonstrates residence.  Here's an incomplete list of things I've done:

*  added a ceiling fan to the bedroom

*  rewired the doorbell with modern wire so it doesn't ring everytime you walk past the dining room heat register

*  added shelving, a phone jack and power outlets to create a `server corner`_

*  added appliance-grade outlets behind the stove and fridge (rather than the ungrounded lamp-grade extension cords running through holes in the floor they previously had)

*  added a `motion light`_ to the break-in-ariffic back yard

*  cleaned out the gutters (I *knew* there's a reason I got that condo)

*  replaced the rotting wiring for the basement lighting
