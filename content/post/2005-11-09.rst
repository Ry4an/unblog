Pocket Pair Palsy
-----------------

A little googling shows I'm the first person to (publically) coin the phrase *pocket pair palsy* to describe the adrenaline powered tremors poker players get when they've got a good hand.  Dibs.

I would argue that palsy is not the best condition to compare this to.  While involuntary movement is occasionally the result of palsy, paralysis is more common and likely.  Some definitions of palsy do not even include tremor-like movements.

I know that we both know people who have dealt with Bell's Palsy, which is indeed primarily paralysis, but most people still associate *palsy* more with tremors than with paralysis.  Besides, St. Vitus's Hole Cards just doesn't have the alliteration thing going for it. -- Ry4an
