Home Repair and Misc.
---------------------

When I don't post here in a while it either means I'm not building anything new or that I'm too busy to write about what I am doing.  This time it's the later.  Not that any of it's been exciting, but almost all of it involved using a saw, which totally counts.

Gwin, our eldest cat, has always kicked toys into the basement sump for the joy of watching humans pick them out later.  Milo, on the other hand, likes running into the muddy sump and then running up stairs.  To keep the cats and their toys out I built a little wooden frame to fit and covered it with chicken wire.  It's ugly but functional.

At some point during Monday night's storm a 20' branch fell from the sky and broke our fence gate.  Neither of us woke up.  Sometimes I park my car right where it landed, and I'm glad Monday wasn't one of those times.  Repair was just a matter of replacing a few pickets and fixing the latch.  The latch has never worked well and still doesn't, but it's slightly better, which I keep telling Kate counts as fixing it.

Meager construction efforts aside I've been working on some big things at work and on our [http://kateandry4an.org/gallery/invitation wedding invitations], which we hope to mail in the next week or two.
