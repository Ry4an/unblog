Detecting Recently Used Words On the Fly
----------------------------------------

When writing I frequently find myself searching backward, either visually or using a reverse-find, to see if I've previously used the word that I've just used.  Some words, say *furthermore* for example, just can't show up more than once per paragraph or two without looking overused.

I was thinking that if my editor/word-processor had a feature wherein all instances of the word I just typed were briefly highlighted it would allow me to notice awkward repeats without having to actively watch for them.  Nothing terribly intrusive, mind you, but just a quick flicker of highlight while I type.

A little time spent figuring out key bindings in vim, my editor of choice, left me with this ugly looking command:


::

   inoremap <space> <esc>"zyiw:let @/=@z<cr>`.a<space>


As a proof-of-concept, it works pretty much exactly how I described, though it breaks down a bit around punctuation and double spaces.  I'm sure someone with stronger vim-fu could iron out the kinks, but it's good enough for me for now.  Here's a mini-screenshot of the highlighting in action.

I'm sure the makers of real word processors, like open office, could add such a feature without much work, but maybe no one but me would ever use it.
