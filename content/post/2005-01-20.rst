2004 Email Response Patterns
----------------------------

`Back in 2003`_ I started tracking some numbers on my email use patterns, especially related to replies.  I ran those old scripts on my 2004 mail and the numbers look pretty similar:

*  Of the 3236 emails I sent during 2004, 2094 of them were replies

*  My five most common response times in minutes were:

  *  ten minutes: 40 times

  *  thireen minutes: 36 times

  *  sixteen minutes: 36 times

  *  twelve minutes: 35 times

  *  eleven minutes: 33 times

*  My mean response times was 22.36 minutes

*  My longest response time was 58.4 days.

The only really meaningful number there is the median response time and comparing it to 2003, I'm a lot faster in general.

My email volume by year is:

====  ===========
Year  Emails Sent
====  ===========
2000  1920
2001  1799
2002  1920
2003  3136
2004  3236
====  ===========

Looking at that table it's pretty easy to tell when I started working from home again.

Here's the histogram for 2004:
