Poker Table
-----------

As mentioned previously I'm a tool of the media machine and am thus now playing poker.  I don't like online play so I host local events here at the house.  We're getting more and more people and I wanted something nicer on which to play than folding card tables.  Louis Duhon, a friend, and I drew up some plans, bought a lot of materials, moved the cars out of his garage, and spent four days working on a "one day project".

The result was some very nice tables with high end vinyl, velveteen, and birch.  For the $250 we spent on materials we could have bought some low end tables but nothing approaching what we ended up with quality wise. Below is a photo and the plans in AutoCAD's DXF format and as a .png. Louis has a lot more photos at http://www.theshadowzone.org/media/poker-tables/poker-tables.html .
