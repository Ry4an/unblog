My Halloween costume this year came out pretty well.  I went as Alex from Kubrick's *A Clockwork Orange* during his brainwashing.  I made the head piece from scrap metal, some syringes, galvanized steel wire, rubber tubing, and a lot of rivets.  The actual actor was temporarily blinded during the filming of that scene, but I went less hard-core on the eye restraints and the only after effects I've got are some bruising and puffiness.  All in all better than I was hoping for.  See the attached image for a photo.  Thanks to the Kromhout clan for the photo.
