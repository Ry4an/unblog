Campfire Frozen Pizza
---------------------

Last weekend I was camping and the person buying the food bought frozen pizzas.  I couldn't think of any good way to cook them until I saw we had some aluminum foil.  We defrosted the pizzas and cut them into slices.  Slices were places *face-to-face*, wrapped in two layers of tin foil, and then tossed into the coals of our fire.  After ten minutes or so they were fished out, and they'd turned into perfectly palatable pizza-pocket-alikes.  It's not good camping food, but its better than raw frozen pizza.

but was it freschetta rising crust pizza?  that stuff is good.  especially with pre-packaged caesar salad.
