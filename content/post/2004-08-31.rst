I Buy Liquor For Minors
-----------------------

It's not much of a creation, but I recently made a T-shirt that says, "I BUY LIQUOR FOR MINORS" in nice white on black lettering.  I've worn it out a few times including to the Minnesota State Fair, mostly just to gauge responses to the sentiment.  It seems the average parent furrows their brow, the average teenager looks intrigued, and the average bartender will still sell me two beers.  I didn't actually have a single youth ask me to buy liquor for them, and all the people who actually told me they liked the shirt were in their 20s or 30s.  Completely not the responses I expected.

People in their 20s and 30s aren't as likely to have rebelious, teenage kids.   Any plans for an "I Slip Babies the Whiskey Teet" derivative? That might make people in their 20s and 30s a more interesting control group. -- Gabe Turner
