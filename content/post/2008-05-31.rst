Home Carbonator
---------------

Last year I `read about home carbonation`_, and looking at the amount of club soda Kate and I buy it made sense.  The only unknown was where to put the ugly tank that would be out of sight yet still convenient to use.

Months later coworkers and I were at the `Red Stag`_, which carbonates their own sparkling water, and talked about doing the same at the office. I still didn't act until a friend got a `soda club`_ machine as a gift.

This weekend I (or actually Kate since I was running late) went to `Northern Brewer`_ and picked up parts ``K003``, ``KX03``, and ``K026`` to build the setup below.  It really does work as easy as the first article promises, and the price including the purchase of a tank came to $200 total.  So far the best thing we've carbonated was orange juice, but I'm looking to try some fruit purees soon.
