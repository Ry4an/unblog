Last week Kate, Natz, and I painted a few more rooms, added handles to the cabinets, added some bookshelves, and did a lot of minor repairs around the condo in preparation for selling it.  I also cut up the throw pillows and sewed some arm covers for the couch.  They look as cheesy as arm covers always do, but they hide the cat damage.
