There's a purchase agreement in place for the condo, and it's time to organize the moving extravaganza.  Saturday, June 17th at 11am moving helpers generous with their time will find everything pre-boxed, wrapped, stacked, and ready.  Half the stuff will be going to Salvation Army down the street and half will be moving from 580 N 2nd St. #120 to 330 E 50th St.  I'm renting a large truck (and possibly selling off a good fraction of the furniture in advance), so with luck we'll be on to the beer and lots of food portion of the afternoon after just one short trip.

Please let me know if you think you can make it so I can plan food supply and figure out if I need to start trying to call up moving karma chits by name.

Thanks,

Yay! We'll finally have a sofa for people to sit on.
