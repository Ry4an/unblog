May Wrap-Up
-----------

The policy here at the UnBlog is that I only write up things I've created -- not just things I've seen.  Last month, however, most all my creative output went into work, with very little time and energy left for side projects.  I've got a few nearing completion, but nothing worth writing about yet.

I did manage to get a few small projects done -- some of which involved a little ingenuity:

*  installed a ceiling fan in a 1920s era home -- with creative ceiling patching and wiring required

*  disassembled and diagnosed my broken washing machine

*  repaired a broken sandal using the sheet bend and two-half-hitches

*  painted a room

Hey, it's not much, but neither is my quantity of available free time.

what a lucky person to have all those projects done for them.  who ever would that be???  since of course you don't wear sandals or have a 1921 house. -- Kate Bauer
