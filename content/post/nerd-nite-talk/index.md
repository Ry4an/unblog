Back in 2018 I gave a 15 minute talk at [Ann Arbor Nerd
Nite](https://annarbor.nerdnite.com/2018/02/05/thurs-feb-15-2018-nna2-52-fighting-phragmites-buying-bitcoin-celebrating-sitcoms/),
and I just came across the video again.  I think it holds up, and I was glad the
video shows the audience seemed to have a good time too.

I really like public speaking *because* it's terrifying.  I get a huge
adrenaline rush and stuggle to control my breathing.  It's like skydiving but
without the actual risk.

Thanks, Ann Arbor Nerd Nite, for letting me speak and sending me the video.
