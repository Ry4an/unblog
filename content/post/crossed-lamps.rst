Last weekend we bought two Rodd_ lamps at Ikea for the guest room, and it struck
me how amused I'd be if each one switched the other.  Six hours and a few new
parts later, and it came out pretty well:

The remote action is especially jarring because the switches are right next to
the bulbs they would normally control:

I really lucked out with those lamps.  The switches aren't integral to the bulb
sockets as is often the case, and they're not even soldered.  I was able to fit
two extra wires through the lamp's main tube without going to a wire gauge that
felt scarily thin -- LED bulbs helped there.

Kate felt the whole thing would just annoy people so I built a hidden control
box under the bed:

With that in place we can disable the effect, or have both lamps controlled by
one side's switch, which is almost arguably useful.
