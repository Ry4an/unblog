Kate and I like old homes even if they come with a lot of mechanical puzzles.
One of my favorite features on our current 100+ year old home is its original
oak and stained glass front door.

A hundred years of slamming and freezing weather had left the stained glass
precariously loose with broken zinc came and gaps you could pass a pencil
though.  After a lot of hunting we found a local restoration company who did
a great job fixing the window using all the original glass and new lead came.

With the pristine glass it really showed how the whole door was in pretty shabby
shape, so after six months I finally got around to sanding it down and
re-painting.  It wasn't much of a project, taking only an afternoon, but
I couldn't be happier with the results.  The brass doorknocker cleaned up
wonderfully, but the modern-ish lock set is fake-antique bronze on metal, and
just wasn't going to ever shine up right.

With half a can of paint left I probably won't let it get quite so run down 
before taking care of it again.  No Rolling Stones were played during the
execution of this project.
