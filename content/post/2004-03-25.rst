Cheap Ass Games (http://cheapass.com) make a lot of great games which are available for very little money.  A perennial favorite is Kill Doctor Lucky which is sort of like Clue, in reverse, and with a better sense of humor.  It's an easy game to learn from the rules, but no one wants to read the rules.  I've found that putting this turn sequence diagram I whipped up in front of a first time player augmented with a quick explanation of killing and failure is enough to get someone from zero to playing in 30 seconds.  Maybe the computer geeks with whom I hang out are more into state diagrams than the general populace, but it works for us.

The attached image shows the diagram.  The attached archive contains the source diagram, a .pdf version, and a the same image.
