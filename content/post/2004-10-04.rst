I'm again going against the 'only things that I create' policy for this mailing list, but unless you count lactic acid nothing was creating during my running of the twin cities marathon yesterday, yet I'm posting about it just the same.  I beat my target time by a good 15 minutes though was still certainly in the tail-end of the pack zone.  I hope to never run so much again so long as I live.
