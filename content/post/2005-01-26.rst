Jetty with Large File Support
-----------------------------

Jetty_ is a great Java servlet container and web server.  It's fully embeddable and at OnionNetworks we've used it in many of our products.  It, however, has the same `2GiB file size limit`_ that a lot of software does.  This limit comes from using a 32 bit wide value to store file size yeilding a 4GiB (unsigned) or 2GiB (signed) maximum, and represents a real design gaff on the part of the developers.

Here at OnionNetworks we needed that limit eliminated so last year I twiddled the fields and modified the accessors wherever necessary.  After `initially offering a fix`_ and `eventually posting the fix`_ it looks like Greg is `getting ready to include it`_ thanks in part `to external pressure`_.  Now if only Sun would fix `the root of the problem`_.
