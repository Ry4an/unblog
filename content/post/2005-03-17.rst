SwarmStream Article on the O'Reilly Network
-------------------------------------------

I wrote `an article`_ that got posted on the O'Reilly Network.  It sounds a little more huckster-ish than I'd like, but the tech does get explained pretty well.  There's a link to the new beta 2 release of `SwarmStream Public Edition`_ at the bottom of the article.
