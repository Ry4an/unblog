It's time once again for that marriage of mathematics and paranoia that is a cryptographic key signing.  I'm organizing another for Thursday, January 20th, 2005.   Details can be found at: https://ry4an.org/keysigning/  Results from my last key signing can be found at: http://ry4an.org/keysigning/visualize/

If all that's gibberish to you, check you my much better explanation last time I did one of these: https://ry4an.org/unblog/msg00026.html

Thanks once again to the ACM for letting us use their room.
