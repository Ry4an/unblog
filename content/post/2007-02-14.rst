View Any Simon Delivers Order
-----------------------------

I forwarded a Simon Delivers order receipt email on to a friend, and he was able to view the order without being logged in as me.  Turns out that if you have a Simon Delivers account at all they let you view any order.  I created a `quick web form`_ to let anyone view any order using my account.  Here's my favorite order so far:

[Table not converted]

I'm sure fixing this problem is simple as adding whatever the .asp equivalent of this is:


::

   if (currentUser != order.user) {
       return;
   }


Funny, though.

If you `try you own`_ and stumble across any funny ones put the order number in the comments.
