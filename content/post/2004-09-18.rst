Mail To Wiki Gateway
--------------------

I wanted a way to quickly append text to Moin Moin wikis.  I wrote a Perl script to do just that.  It relies on the email address suffix features available in most modern MTAs to get the page name.

Once the procmail recipe included in the accompanying procmail.rc file is in place for the user 'wiki' email sent to `wiki-TextHere@somewhere.com`_ will be appended to the TextHere wiki page.

I cheaped out on the formatting and just put the text inside literal/pre blocksblocks.  The subject line and from header are retained and displayed.

By default the posts are done under no user, but the included makecookie.pl can be used to create a cookie file that the script will use to persist a wiki login (I tend to use EmailGateway).

It looks like there's been some updating and porting discussion of this script at `ScriptMarket/EmailToWikiGateway`_
