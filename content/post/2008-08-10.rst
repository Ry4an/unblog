Is the Jerry Farber piece, an anthem of my youth, not copyrighted?  Do you have permission?  Where can I reach Farber? -- Some Random Person

Presumably you're referring to this_, though I've no idea why you attached the comment to my daughter's birth announcement.  I typed this from a blurry photocopy twenty years ago.  If the copyright holder objects, I'll happily remove it.
