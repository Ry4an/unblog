Ivy and Stucco
--------------

This weekend was full of discoveries involving ivy and stucco and removing the former from the later.  Summarizing them we have:

1. **Don't**.  Keep them away from one another.  If you have a stucco home and your neighbor plants ivy secretly poison it.

#. If there is ivy on your stucco, just leave it there.  Removing it is not worth the pain.

#. If you do remove the ivy, remove it completely.  If you pull it off and plan on getting the residual debris later, you're going to find it's dried to a state where it can no longer be pulled off in strands like it can be when green.

#. If you've let residual ivy dry to the point where it's brittle, plan on a day full of power washers, long handled brushes, and ladders.  Try to drink a lot.  Expect to repaint.
