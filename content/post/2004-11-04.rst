AntFlow 1.0rc1 Released
-----------------------

I code for a hobby and a profession, but usually it's only the hobby stuff I can release here.  However I'm happy to say and proud to announce that Onion Networks, my employer, has okay-ed the release of AntFlow, a tool I largely wrote.

AntFlow adds hot folder triggers and workflow functionality to the ever popular Ant build tool.  It's a great fit and a right good bit of code, so check it out at http://antflow.onionnetworks.com/ .
