Posthumous Key Revocation
==========================

I've just emptied out my safe deposit box for the move, and thought I'd re-post
this: 

If you hear I've died someone who knows their way around gpg should ask Kate for
the CD pictured below. It'll be in a safe deposit box that's in my name, and
she'll have access after my death. There's a key_ revocation certificate with reason
'death' on the CD and a printed ASCII-armored version too since the odds of us
being able to read CDs in a few decades is approximately nil.
