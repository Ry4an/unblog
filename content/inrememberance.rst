When I hear that donations are being taken for charity X in memory of someone who's passed, I often wonder just how the charity was selected.  Did the deceased chose before his or her death, was his or her preferences just commonly known, or is it just what the family wanted.  Similarly, one occasionally sees a tragic death used to futher a political agenda, and it's not clear on which side of the issue in question the deceased actually stood.

I'm not planning on dying anytime soon, but I was thinking that when eventually I do pass a list of things I would have found meaningful might be nice.  I'm sure this website will be long gone, but maybe it'll be archived somewhere.

-------------------------

*  Please don't use my death to further political causes that:

  *  reduce individual rights (including the right to do stupid things such as smoke and ride without helmets or seatbelts)
  *  argue for greater government protection, security, or control
  *  curtail gun ownership

*  Things you can do in rememberance of me:

  *  think open mindedly about a political issue on which we disagreed (hint: there are almost certainly many from which to pick)
  *  sign your organ donation card
  *  give to a charity/foundation that:

    *  supports individual rights
    *  furthers the progress of 3rd parties in the U.S.

*  If I was the victim of a violent crime please don't:

  *  confuse revenge with justice
  *  push to have a minor tried as an adult
