About
=====

I've had a public online life since 1996, earlier if you count my WWIV BBS, and
this site is the latest iteration.  It brings together all my blog entries since
2003 and whatever old content is still relevant.  Of course, a great deal of my
online life exists on other sites, listed below, but I try to keep anything
substantial here.

If there's anything in my life that passes as a FAQ, it's the four in my name.  
Covering the standard questions: It's not a typo. It is legal, and it's silent
when pronounced.  I added the four 20 years ago for what seemed like good
reasons at the time.  I'm still quite fond of it even if it does make every
aspect of my life very easy to Google.  Besides, if I thought about changing
back I'd have a tattoo to remove.
